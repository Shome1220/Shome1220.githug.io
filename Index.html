        <h1>My name is Shani Rodgers</h1>
        <p>I am a student at Wake Tech. I thought I liked coding and programming but I am starting to see it is more than I thought. I like to spend time with my family and eating. I love eating.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about learning even though I am an older student. I like working independently but don't mind working with others.</p>
        <p>In the future, I hope to advance in my career with my current employer as an analyst.</p>
